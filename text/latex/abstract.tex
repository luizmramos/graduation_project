This work analyses the problem of text classification in the context of social networks (Facebook, specifically). Different versions of Multinomial Naïve Bayes were implemented using only words as features at first, then some post's metadata too. Since the results were not satisfying, a Weighted Naïve Bayes model was implemented with weights based on Information Theory, which significantly improved the classifier's performance.

Afterwards, a chrome extension, that modifies the News Feed adding headers to each post with a corresponding tag, was developed. The user can modify this tag if he disagrees with the automatic classification and his feedback allows the Bayesian Network to learn online.
